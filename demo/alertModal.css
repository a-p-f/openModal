/*
	alertModal.css
	Implements a "window" which:
		- is centered horizontally in the viewport
		- grows as needed (vertically) to fit content
		- supports a "minimum margin" around the window
		- supports a border and border radius
		- scrolls within the window, 
			rather than moving the entire window in the viewport

	Requires one div, with class AlertWindow wrapping all content of the body

	Most styles should not be overridden, except where indicated.
